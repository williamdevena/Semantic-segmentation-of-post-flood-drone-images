# Deep Learning based approach for Semantic Segmentation of flood event Aerial images
BSc Final Project (2021/2022)

![My Image](example_segme.png)

Semantic segmentation of the aerial images in the FloodNet dataset (https://github.com/BinaLab/FloodNet-Supervised_v1.0).

The repository is divided as follows:
- colab_notebooks --> contains the colab notebooks
- source --> contains the code
- thesis_latex --> contains the latex material 
- comparison_with_ground_truth --> shows examples of comparisons between the model output and the ground truth
- thesis --> pdf of the original thesis relation (sorry it's in italian :sweat_smile:)
- translated_thesis_google_translate --> automatically translated thesis relation (using google translate)
- thesis_presentation --> power point of thesis presentation
- translated_presentation_google_translate --> automatically translated thesis presentation (using google translate)
